## Overview

KZDownloader is a cross-platform desktop application built with Flutter that lets you download videos, music, and generic files from hundreds of websites. It integrates a powerful AI assistant that can summarize YouTube video content and answer questions about it.

The interface is organized into dedicated sections — **Videos**, **Music**, and **Generic files** — each with its own tailored view and controls. The design is modern, minimal, and fully reactive, featuring animated neon/rainbow gradient borders on download cards and interactive elements, smooth transitions, and real-time progress feedback.

## ✨ Features

### 🎬 Video & Audio Downloads
- Download videos and audio from **YouTube** and hundreds of other platforms powered by [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).
- Choose **video format** (MP4, MKV) and **quality** before downloading, with two selector modes:
  - **Simple**: Best · High · Medium · Low
  - **Expert**: 2160p (4K) · 1440p · 1080p · 720p · 480p
- Download entire **YouTube playlists** with configurable concurrency — each video is tracked individually.
- Audio-only extraction to **MP3, M4A, OGG (Vorbis)**.

### 📁 Generic File Downloader (IDM-like)
- Multi-threaded, **IDM-style chunked download** for any direct HTTP/HTTPS link.
- Automatic **resume support** — interrupted downloads pick up where they left off if the server supports range requests.
- Per-chunk progress visualization with active worker count and individual segment progress bars.
- Built on a Rust-based HTTP backend ([rhttp_plus](https://pub.dev/packages/rhttp_plus)) for maximum throughput and **TLS fingerprinting** to avoid bot-detection on protected servers.

### 🤖 AI — Video Summaries & Chat
- Automatically fetch the **transcript / description** of a YouTube video and generate a structured summary using an LLM.
- Ask **follow-up questions** in a persistent chat session tied to the video — Q&A history is saved locally.
- Support for multiple AI providers:
  - **Ollama** (fully local, no data leaves the machine)
  - **OpenAI** (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, …)
  - **Google Gemini** (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Flash, …)
- Streaming text output with animated Markdown rendering.
- Configurable context size (max characters fed to the LLM).

### 🎵 Music Library & Player
- Dedicated **Music** tab listing all downloaded audio files.
- Built-in **audio player** with a progress bar, play/pause, skip, and seek controls.
- **Playlist management**: create named playlists and add tracks to them.

### 🔒 Security & Integrity
- **Checksum verification** (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512) before triggering a download, ensuring file integrity.
- API keys stored in **secure storage** (OS keychain / credential manager).

### ⚙️ Settings & Customisation
- **Download directory** selection with onboarding prompt on first launch.
- Default **format**, **quality**, and **audio format** presets.
- **Dark / Light / System** theme with smooth transitions.
- **Interface language**: English and Italian.
- Configurable **concurrent downloads** per-playlist and globally.
- AI model and provider selection with API key management.

### 🖥️ Desktop Experience
- Interface split into dedicated sections: **Videos**, **Music**, and **Generic files** — each with its own layout, sorting, and search.
- Modern, minimal, and fully reactive design with real-time progress updates.
- Animated **neon gradient borders** (`RainbowAnimatedBorder`) around download cards and interactive elements, rendered via a custom `CustomPainter`.
- Glassmorphism glow blobs on the home screen and smooth CSS-style transitions throughout.
- Responsive layout with separate view adaptations for Windows/Linux and macOS.

## 📦 External Binaries (auto-downloaded on first launch)

KZDownloader automatically downloads and manages the following external tools into the app's support directory — no manual installation required:

| Binary | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **yt-dlp** | Video/audio download and metadata extraction |
| **ffmpeg** | Post-processing, remuxing, and audio extraction |
| **deno** | Scripting support for advanced operations |

## ⬇️ Download

Pre-compiled binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux are available directly in the [**Releases**](../../releases) section — no build environment needed.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) ≥ 3.2.0
- Dart SDK ≥ 3.2.0
- A desktop target configured (`flutter config --enable-windows-desktop` / `--enable-macos-desktop` / `--enable-linux-desktop`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/KZDownloader.git
cd KZDownloader

# Install Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run code generation (Isar + Riverpod)
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Launch on your platform
flutter run -d windows   # or macos / linux
```

### First Launch

On the first run KZDownloader will:
1. Ask you to select a **default download directory**.
2. Automatically download **yt-dlp** and **ffmpeg** in the background.

For AI features, open **Settings** and choose an AI provider:
- **Ollama**: install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) locally and pull a model (e.g. `ollama pull llama3`).
- **OpenAI / Google**: enter your API key in the Settings panel — it is stored securely in the OS keychain.

## 📋 Supported Platforms

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| Windows | ✅ Full support |
| macOS | ✅ Full support (adapted layout) |
| Linux | ✅ Full support |
| Android / iOS | ⚠️ Experimental (not primary target) |
